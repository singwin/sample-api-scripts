# Sample API scripts

This repo contains sample scripts in various languages. These scripts use the
Vega core and wallet APIs to interact with Vega core nodes and wallet servers.

# Gitpod

Get started with the sample API scripts with zero configuration. Click on the
"Gitpod ready-to-code" button above.

# Getting started

1. Copy or rename the `credentials-template` file as `credentials`.  
*Note: When running on Gitpod this is already done for you.*
1. Edit the `credentials` file. (`nano` and `vim` are installed, or use the built-in Gitpod text editor.)
1. Import the credentials into your local environment: `source credentials`

And you're good to go. Now choose a sample program to run from the following (see the link in the **Folder** column to learn how to run each sample script):

# Troubleshooting

Python/terminal: If you get `No module named 'helpers'...`, you should enter `source credentials` and check with `echo "$PYTHONPATH"` than it shows `"."`.
